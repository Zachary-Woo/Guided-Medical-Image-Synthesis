Great. I’ll look into optimal approaches for generating anatomically plausible synthetic medical images using diffusion models. I’ll focus on better feature extraction than canny (such as SAM or segmentation-based methods), potentially better datasets than PathMNIST for structure-aware generation, and existing pre-trained or fine-tunable Stable Diffusion models for medical imaging that can run on a 24GB GPU. I’ll also highlight integration points for LoRA or ControlNet if appropriate.

I’ll share options with relevant links, usage guidance, and integration tips for your current pipeline.

# Preserving Anatomy in Synthetic Medical Image Generation

## 1. Structurally-Annotated Medical Image Datasets 
Using datasets that include segmentation masks or structured annotations is crucial for guiding generative models to maintain realistic anatomy. **PathMNIST**, for example, contains 100,000 pathology image patches labeled by tissue type but no pixel-level structure labels ([MedMNIST v2 - A large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2D and 3D biomedical image classification | Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01721-8#:~:text=The%20PathMNIST%20is%20based%20on,treated%20as%20the%20test%20set)). As alternatives, consider datasets with explicit **segmentation masks** or **anatomical annotations**: 

- **Histopathology (H&E)** – *GlaS (Gland Segmentation)*: 165 colorectal histology images with carefully annotated glandular boundaries (colon cancer tissue) ([Gland segmentation in colon histology images: The glas challenge ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841516301542#:~:text=,Each)). *MoNuSeg (Multi-Organ Nuclei Segmentation)*: 30 H&E images (1000×1000) containing ~22,000 labeled cell nuclei from multiple organs ([Data - MoNuSeg - Grand Challenge](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/#:~:text=Training%20data%20containing%2030%20images,dataset%20article%20in%20IEEE)). These provide masks of cellular or glandular structures for preserving microscopic anatomy.  
- **Radiology (X-ray/CT/MRI)** – *BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation)*: Multi-modal MRI scans with tumor masks ([Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Deep Learning on MRI Images](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10177460/#:~:text=Images%20pmc,Annotated%20MRI%20images%20from)), useful for brain MRI generation that retains tumor shape. *NIH Chest X-ray14 + Annotations*: 112,000+ chest X-rays with disease labels; while segmentation masks are limited, projects like SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax (Kaggle) added lung masks for thousands of X-rays to localize collapsed lung regions.  
- **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)** – A compilation of **10 diverse 3D datasets** (2,633 volumes) covering organs like liver, heart, hippocampus, prostate, lung tumors, etc., each with voxel-level segmentations ([Medical Segmentation Decathlon Dataset | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/medical-segmentation-decathlon#:~:text=The%20Medical%20Segmentation%20Decathlon%20is,Simpson%20et%20al%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1902.09063.pdf)). Slices or projections from these can be used to condition 2D generation on organ shapes. For example, the MSD *Liver* task provides CT scans with liver and tumor masks, and the *Pancreas* task has abdominal CT with pancreas masks – both valuable for structure-guided synthesis.  
- **Dermatology** – *ISIC 2018*: 2,594 dermoscopic images of skin lesions with segmentation masks outlining each lesion ([ISIC 2018 Task 1 Dataset | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/isic-2018-task-1#:~:text=The%20ISIC%202018%20dataset%20was,archive.com%2Ftask1)). Such delineations can guide generative models to preserve lesion shape and border when creating synthetic skin images.  

These datasets come with **paired images and labels (masks, boundaries)**, enabling training of *structure-extraction tools* and providing ground truth for **ControlNet** conditioning or evaluation of anatomical fidelity. In practice, one can use the images and their segmentation masks to train conditional generative models that learn a mapping from structure to image (e.g. segmentation-to-image synthesis) for more realistic outputs. Leveraging these rich annotations will help ensure synthetic images respect real anatomical layouts and variations.

## 2. Fine-Tuned Generative Models for Medical Imaging 
Modern diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion) can be **fine-tuned** on medical data to produce high-fidelity domain-specific images. Fine-tuning can be done either by updating the full model (e.g. via DreamBooth) or more efficiently via **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation). Several community and research efforts have produced specialized checkpoints:

- **Chest X-Ray Diffusion Models**: Multiple groups have fine-tuned Stable Diffusion on chest X-ray datasets. For example, *Danyal Malik et al.* fine-tuned Stable Diffusion v2.1 on the NIH ChestXray-14 dataset (frontal CXR images) to generate synthetic chest X-rays ([GitHub - mdanyalmalik/chest-xray-synthesis: Using GANs and Stable Diffusion to generate Chest Xray data points and evaluating them using convolutional classifiers.](https://github.com/mdanyalmalik/chest-xray-synthesis#:~:text=Pre)). They reported that the generated images were *“visually convincing”* and even improved a classifier’s performance when used for data augmentation ([[2305.18927] Evaluating the feasibility of using Generative Models to generate Chest X-Ray Data](http://ar5iv.org/abs/2305.18927#:~:text=,However%2C%20further%20work%20is)). Similarly, a DreamBooth model “ChestX_ray” (by KidderLab) was trained to generate chest X-rays using prompt tokens (e.g. `nihchestxray chest x-ray`) ([KidderLab/Chest_X-ray · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/KidderLab/Chest_X-ray#:~:text=,Model%20by%20Benjamin%20Kidder)), and LoRA adaptations like *“Doctor Diffusion’s XRay LoRA”* can turn a generic model into an X-ray style generator by prepending the word “xray” in prompts ([DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora#:~:text=Use%20,of%20your%20prompt)). These models run comfortably on a 24 GB GPU (most are based on SD v1.5 or v2 at 512px resolution, which require <10 GB in half-precision) ([DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora#:~:text=import%20torch)). A 24 GB RTX 4090 is even sufficient for higher resolutions or Stable Diffusion 2.x/XL with optimizations (e.g. mixed precision). In one case, a researcher fine-tuned **Stable Diffusion XL** on a set of labeled MRI scans, demonstrating that SDXL can learn medical imagery when given domain-specific data ([Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion XL: A Practical Guide | by Hey Amit | Medium](https://medium.com/@heyamit10/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-xl-a-practical-guide-a4b3e579ce9a#:~:text=images%20of%20similar%20styles%20made,labels%20to%20guide%20the%20model)). 

- **Other Modalities**: Researchers have adapted diffusion models to a variety of medical imaging modalities. For instance, *RoentGen* is a vision-language diffusion model specialized for radiology (chest X-ray) generation from text reports ([SeLoRA: Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation of Latent Diffusion Model for Medical Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07196v1#:~:text=Chaudhari%2C%20A.%3A%20Roentgen%3A%20Vision,2022)). In dermatology, Stable Diffusion has been fine-tuned on dermoscopic images to create realistic skin lesions for training data expansion (often via smaller-scale fine-tuning methods like textual inversion) ([amirhossein-kz/Awesome-Diffusion-Models-in-Medical-Imaging](https://github.com/amirhossein-kz/Awesome-Diffusion-Models-in-Medical-Imaging#:~:text=amirhossein,Silva%2C%20Marina%20Musse%20Bernardes)) ([Medical diffusion on a budget: Textual Inversion for medical image ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369476706_Medical_diffusion_on_a_budget_textual_inversion_for_medical_image_generation#:~:text=Medical%20diffusion%20on%20a%20budget%3A,to%20various%20medical%20imaging)). Even endoscopy has seen diffusion use: a recent study fine-tuned Stable Diffusion on laparoscopic surgery images (the CholecT45 dataset) and used it to translate simulated scenes into realistic surgical images ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=follows%3A)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=or%20enhanced%20compared%20to%20the,com%2FSanoScience%2Fsim2real_with_Stable_Diffusion)). The **MedVQA-GI Challenge (2024)** also spurred work in generative models for gastrointestinal imagery – one team combined fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth+LoRA, finding that the plain fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model achieved the best image fidelity (FID as low as 0.064–0.099) and diversity (Inception Score ~2.33) on the challenge datasets ([Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.20667v1#:~:text=specified%20categories,This%20advances%20the%20field)). This highlights that a well-finetuned diffusion model can outperform naive applications of CLIP or unrefined DreamBooth in medical image generation.

**LoRA Integration:** LoRA has become popular for medical applications because it requires only training a few MB of weights while the base model (often SD1.5 or SD2.1) remains mostly frozen ([Using LoRA for Efficient Stable Diffusion Fine-Tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/lora#:~:text=,size%20of%20the%20UNet%20model)) ([Using LoRA for Efficient Stable Diffusion Fine-Tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/lora#:~:text=With%20LoRA%2C%20it%20is%20now,tuned%20model)). This makes fine-tuning feasible with limited images. For example, using LoRA, a full diffusion model can be adapted on a single 11 GB GPU to a new medical domain ([Using LoRA for Efficient Stable Diffusion Fine-Tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/lora#:~:text=,size%20of%20the%20UNet%20model)). There are many LoRA weights available (often on Hugging Face Hub) that can be loaded into base checkpoints at inference time. For instance, loading the *DoctorDiffusion* X-ray LoRA onto `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` via HuggingFace’s diffusers API will let you generate “X-ray” style images from any prompt ([DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora#:~:text=import%20torch)). This modularity means you could maintain one base model and swap in different LoRAs for *MRI*, *CT*, *Ultrasound*, etc. All these fine-tuned models should run on a 24 GB GPU with room to spare, especially when using half-precision (`torch.float16`) and memory optimizations (e.g. attention slicing or CPU offloading if needed).

**Checkpoints and Links:** Many fine-tuned models and LoRAs are shared openly. For example, the chest X-ray SD2.1 model by Malik *et al.* is available (as a weights file ~2GB, or a LoRA ~ tens of MB) ([GitHub - mdanyalmalik/chest-xray-synthesis: Using GANs and Stable Diffusion to generate Chest Xray data points and evaluating them using convolutional classifiers.](https://github.com/mdanyalmalik/chest-xray-synthesis#:~:text=Pre)). The *Medical Diffusion* GitHub “Awesome Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging” ([amirhossein-kz/Awesome-Diffusion-Models-in-Medical-Imaging](https://github.com/amirhossein-kz/Awesome-Diffusion-Models-in-Medical-Imaging#:~:text=amirhossein,Silva%2C%20Marina%20Musse%20Bernardes)) curates numerous such checkpoints (covering X-ray, MRI, pathology, etc.). When using these models, be mindful of their training data and intended use: a model trained on, say, **MIMIC-CXR** data will produce anatomically plausible chest images (lungs, heart, ribcage) but won’t know about modalities outside its domain. Always pair the model with appropriate prompts (or ControlNet guidance, below) to get the desired output. 

## 3. Advanced Segmentation (SAM) for Structure Extraction 
To extract anatomical structure for conditioning generation, state-of-the-art segmentation models like **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** have been explored in medical imaging. SAM is a foundation model trained on millions of natural images to produce segmentation masks from simple prompts (points, boxes). **Out-of-the-box, SAM often struggles on medical images** because medical boundaries and textures differ greatly from natural photos. For example, a Nature Communication study evaluated SAM on 19 medical segmentation tasks and found it “ranked last place in almost all tasks” with frequent under/over-segmentation of ambiguous boundaries ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=first%20place%20on%20most%20tasks%2C,even%20better%20than%20the%20specialist)). Simply put, an unmodified SAM might misidentify organs or miss tumor margins, limiting its direct use for structure guidance.

The solution is to **fine-tune or adapt SAM to medical data**. One approach is **MedSAM**, a SAM model fine-tuned on a large collection of medical images with segmentation labels ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=MedSAM%20accomplishes%20this%20by%20fine,in%20medical%20image%20segmentation%20tasks)). MedSAM achieves substantially higher Dice scores and can accurately segment a wide range of targets (organs, lesions) across CT, MRI, ultrasound, endoscopy, etc., often *matching or outperforming dedicated models (U-Net, DeepLabV3)* ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=first%20place%20on%20most%20tasks%2C,even%20better%20than%20the%20specialist)). For instance, MedSAM’s median Dice on an internal benchmark of 86 tasks was far above SAM’s (often by 20–30% absolute) and even surpassed the specialized models in many cases ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=We%20further%20connected%20the%20DSC,9%29%20visualizes%20some%20randomly)) ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=selected%20segmentation%20examples%20where%20MedSAM,Net%20and%20DeepLabV3%2B%20models)). Researchers have further improved SAM for med use: **SAM-Med2D** is a fine-tuned 2D version that showed *“impressive results in cross-modal medical image segmentation”* ([Medical image analysis using improved SAM-Med2D: segmentation and classification perspectives | BMC Medical Imaging | Full Text](https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12880-024-01401-6#:~:text=Recently%20emerged%20SAM,Large%20Visual%20Model%20SAM%20lack)), and a recent extension called **SAM-AutoMed** replaces SAM’s prompt encoder with an automated mechanism (a tuned MobileNetv3) to generate masks without manual prompts ([Medical image analysis using improved SAM-Med2D: segmentation and classification perspectives | BMC Medical Imaging | Full Text](https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12880-024-01401-6#:~:text=Model%20,Med2D%20with%20our%20designed)). This allows fully automatic segmentation of medical images. SAM-AutoMed outperformed both the original SAM and Med2D on multiple organ datasets ([Medical image analysis using improved SAM-Med2D: segmentation and classification perspectives | BMC Medical Imaging | Full Text](https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12880-024-01401-6#:~:text=prompts%20may%20restrict%20its%20applicability,of)), indicating that prompt-free, high-accuracy segmentation is possible in medical contexts.

 ([Fig. 3: Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results on the internal validation set. | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z/figures/3)) *Figure: Comparison of segmentation results on various medical images by original SAM vs specialized models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and fine-tuned MedSAM). The bar plots (top) show MedSAM (green) achieving the highest median Dice scores across 86 tasks, while SAM (blue) lags behind ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=first%20place%20on%20most%20tasks%2C,even%20better%20than%20the%20specialist)). Example outputs (bottom row) on CT, MRI, ultrasound, and endoscopy demonstrate SAM’s inaccuracies (yellow mask vs magenta ground truth), whereas MedSAM produces masks much closer to the ground truth and comparable to U-Net/DeepLab outputs.* 

For **structure extraction** in generative pipelines, using a fine-tuned model like MedSAM is far more reliable than basic edge detectors. A segmentation model can delineate meaningful boundaries (e.g. the precise contour of an organ or lesion) rather than all intensity edges. This semantic accuracy is important – a mask of “kidney” or “tumor” tells the generator exactly which shapes to preserve. In contrast, **Canny edge detection** will pick up arbitrary gradients (even noise or imaging artifacts), which may omit some boundaries or fragment a continuous structure. Indeed, researchers note that SAM (and derivatives) handle *“targets of weak boundaries”* much better than Canny, which often fails to close object contours in medical scans ([Segment anything in medical images | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z#:~:text=selected%20segmentation%20examples%20where%20MedSAM,Net%20and%20DeepLabV3%2B%20models)). For example, an ultrasound tumor might have fuzzy edges that Canny cannot detect, whereas MedSAM can still produce a reasonable mask with the correct shape.

**Practical use:** you can integrate SAM/MedSAM in a pipeline by first running it on an image (or a set of images) to obtain masks for structures of interest. If you don’t have a ground-truth mask ahead of time (as would be the case when *creating* a new image), one idea is to use SAM on a *prototype image* or an *atlas* – e.g. take one real MRI, have SAM segment the organ outlines, then use those masks as conditional inputs to generate new MRI images with the same organ shape. This “structure conditioning” can be done via ControlNet (see next section). In summary, **fine-tuned SAM models have become excellent structure extractors for medical images**, and they provide a far richer conditioning signal than simple edge maps. Leveraging them helps ensure that generative outputs respect true anatomical boundaries instead of hallucinating shapes. 

## 4. LoRA vs. ControlNet for Guided Medical Image Generation 
Both **LoRA** and **ControlNet** can be used to steer image generation, but they serve different purposes and are often complementary. In current practice, **ControlNet is the go-to method for enforcing spatial structure**, while LoRA is used for *domain adaptation or style tuning*. Here’s a comparison based on their roles:

- **LoRA-only Generation:** Applying a LoRA fine-tuned on medical data will imbue the diffusion model with the *appearance and style* of that data (e.g. the texture of an X-ray or the color scheme of pathology slides) ([How LoRA and ControlNet Are Transforming Generative AI | by Efrat ...](https://medium.com/@efrat_37973/from-text-to-image-to-true-customization-how-lora-and-controlnet-are-transforming-generative-ai-b8b5119bae57#:~:text=,consistent%20styles%2C%20characters%2C%20and%20concepts)). It *does not*, however, give you control over the layout of the image beyond what you can describe in text prompts. LoRA excels at teaching the model new concepts (like a particular anatomy or instrument) or improving its fidelity on a domain. For example, a LoRA could teach Stable Diffusion what a “histopathology slide with lymphocytes” looks like – the output will generally contain cell-like shapes, but their arrangement is left to the model’s imagination guided only by text. You cannot guarantee that, say, a tumor appears in a specific location using LoRA alone. In summary, **LoRA improves the *what* (content/style) but not the *where***. 

- **ControlNet-guided Generation:** ControlNet is explicitly designed to **condition diffusion models on structural information** ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20an%20architecture%20designed,The%20locked%20copy%20preserves%20the)). It introduces an additional network that takes a *condition image* (e.g. an edge map, segmentation map, sketch, pose keypoints, etc.) and guides the diffusion process to follow that structure ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20an%20architecture%20designed,The%20locked%20copy%20preserves%20the)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L373%20ControlNet%20is,to%20impose%20diversified)). For medical imaging, this is extremely powerful – one can provide a **segmentation mask** of organs or a skeleton outline of bones, and the model will generate a realistic medical image conforming to that layout. For instance, researchers used ControlNet to impose *surgical instrument and tissue outlines* on a diffusion model for endoscopy, ensuring that synthetic images had organs and tools in the correct places ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=inference%20stage%2C%20the%20fine,Pidinet%20from%20the%20input%20sample)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L405%20completely%20new,34%5D%20models.%20It)). ControlNet can also take *Canny or Pidinet edges* from an input scan (for cases where no manual segmentation is available) to preserve shapes of anatomical structures ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=to%20LC,Pidinet%20from%20the%20input%20sample)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L405%20completely%20new,34%5D%20models.%20It)). The key is that with ControlNet, **the spatial arrangement (anatomical structure) is a first-class input** – giving fine-grained control that pure text or LoRA lacks.

**Which is better?** In practice, these methods address different needs, and they are often used together. If your goal is to **preserve anatomical structure** (for example, you have a label map of a liver and tumor and want to generate a realistic CT image from it), **ControlNet is indispensable** – it will ensure the synthetic image’s liver and tumor match the provided shapes. LoRA alone cannot achieve this level of guidance. On the other hand, if you only have a small medical dataset and want the model to *learn the style/content* (e.g. generating “like PathMNIST” images broadly), LoRA by itself might suffice, but the results will be uncontrolled in layout. Current state-of-the-art workflows therefore often **combine** them: e.g. first fine-tune the base model with LoRA on the medical domain (so it knows how to render realistic anatomy and modality appearance), *then* apply ControlNet to guide the geometry during generation ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=original%20data,34)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L373%20ControlNet%20is,to%20impose%20diversified)). This combo was used in the laparoscopic image synthesis work – they fine-tuned SD on surgery frames (a model called “LC-SD”) and then applied *two ControlNets* (one for coarse layout via tiled image, one for fine edges via PiDiNet) to ensure tissue shapes and details were accurate ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=achieved%20by%20leveraging%20two%20versions,2)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20an%20architecture%20designed,The%20locked%20copy%20preserves%20the)). The result was significantly better at preserving structure (69.8% mIoU) compared to not using ControlNet (42.2% IoU) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=limited%20data%20availability%20in%20clinical,We%20provide%20public%20access%20to)).

One downside of ControlNet in medical imaging is the **need for training data** for new conditions. The original ControlNet models (e.g. for segmentation or depth) were trained on datasets like MS-COCO or ADE20K, which don’t have medical categories ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L396%20Segmentation%20ControlNet,dataset%2C%20which%20is%20described%20in)). If you want a “tumor mask to MRI” ControlNet, you’d ideally train on paired MRI and mask data – which may require a few thousand samples ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20not%20feasible%20as,to%20impose%20diversified)). This can be heavy. A clever trick, however, is to **reuse pre-trained ControlNets**: the endoscopy study found they could apply a *pre-trained edge ControlNet* to their fine-tuned model without additional training ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L373%20ControlNet%20is,to%20impose%20diversified)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20not%20feasible%20as,to%20impose%20diversified)). The ControlNet’s locked weights still impose general “edge fidelity,” which combined with the fine-tuned base model, gave good results. This suggests that even if you can’t train a new ControlNet, using an existing one (like the `softedge` model or `canny` model) will help maintain structure in med images, since edges are somewhat modality-agnostic (an edge is an edge, whether in a photo or X-ray). 

**Verdict:** *Guided generation in medical imaging almost always benefits from ControlNet or similar explicit conditioning.* LoRA alone is usually not “better” at ensuring structure – it addresses a different problem. The field trends toward **using LoRA for tuning the model to the medical domain, and ControlNet (or analogous conditioning like T2I-Adapters) for injecting specific structural constraints**. If forced to choose one: for anatomical accuracy, go with ControlNet (with a suitable preprocessor like SAM or Canny); for lack of data or quick domain adaptation, use LoRA – but expect to relinquish detailed control over the anatomy in each generated image.

## 5. Integration into PyTorch/HuggingFace Pipeline 
Bringing these tools together in an end-to-end PyTorch pipeline is very feasible with the help of Hugging Face’s libraries and other toolkits. Here’s a guide to integrating each component:

- **Hugging Face Diffusers for Stable Diffusion**: Use the `diffusers` library to load the base Stable Diffusion model. For example:  
  ```python
  from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
  pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
  pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
  ```  
  This gives you a text-to-image pipeline. If you have a **fine-tuned model checkpoint** (say a `.ckpt` or Diffusers model), you can load that instead of `stable-diffusion-v1-5`. Many medical models on HuggingFace are in diffusers format; for others, you might convert or directly load via `StableDiffusionPipeline.from_ckpt`. Ensure the model is on GPU (as above, `.to("cuda")`) and in half precision to fit memory.

- **Applying LoRA**: Diffusers supports loading LoRA weights directly. After obtaining a LoRA file (e.g. `med-model-lora.safetensors` on the hub), you can do:  
  ```python
  pipe.load_lora_weights("username/med-model-lora", weight_name="med-model-lora.safetensors")
  ```  
  This will modify the pipeline’s UNet (and optionally text encoder) with the LoRA layers ([DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora#:~:text=import%20torch)). For example, the X-ray LoRA mentioned earlier can be applied in this way to the SD1.5 pipeline ([DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora#:~:text=import%20torch)). Once loaded, simply call `pipe(prompt)` with relevant prompts to generate images. *Tip:* Keep prompt engineering in mind – for some LoRAs you need a trigger word (like “xray” or the class token used during training) ([DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/DoctorDiffusion/doctor-diffusion-s-xray-xl-lora#:~:text=Use%20,of%20your%20prompt)). The model card for the LoRA usually specifies this. You can also **merge** LoRA weights permanently into the model if needed (diffusers has utilities for this), but for experimentation it’s nice to keep them separate.

- **Using ControlNet**: Diffusers provides a `StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline` to which you can attach one or more ControlNets ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=inference%20stage%2C%20the%20fine,Pidinet%20from%20the%20input%20sample)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20an%20architecture%20designed,The%20locked%20copy%20preserves%20the)). First, load a ControlNet model:  
  ```python
  from diffusers import ControlNetModel, StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline
  controlnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
  pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(
      "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", controlnet=controlnet, torch_dtype=torch.float16
  ).to("cuda")
  ```  
  This sets up SD with a Canny-edge ControlNet ([ControlNet in  Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet#:~:text=from%20diffusers%20import%20StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline%2C%20ControlNetModel,import%20torch)). You can swap `"sd-controlnet-canny"` with other pre-trained controls, like `"sd-controlnet-seg"` (for segmentation maps) or `"sd-controlnet-depth"`, depending on what structural input you have. If you want to combine multiple conditions (say, one ControlNet for edges and one for another modality), diffusers allows concatenating multiple ControlNets in a list and summing their influence – as done in the endoscopy paper with Tile+Edge ControlNets ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=achieved%20by%20leveraging%20two%20versions,2)) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=ControlNet%20is%20an%20architecture%20designed,The%20locked%20copy%20preserves%20the)). At inference, prepare your *conditioning image*. For example, if using the Canny model, you need an edge image (single-channel or 3-channel). You can generate this from a mask or a source image:  

  ```python
  import cv2, numpy as np
  from PIL import Image
  # Suppose mask_img is a binary mask (numpy array) of the anatomy.
  edges = cv2.Canny(mask_img, 100, 200)  # or use controlnet_aux utilities
  edges = np.stack([edges]*3, axis=2)  # make 3-channel
  cond_image = Image.fromarray(edges)
  out = pipe(prompt="chest CT scan", image=cond_image, num_inference_steps=30).images[0]
  ```  

  In this example, we created a Canny edge from a mask – one could also use `controlnet_aux` library (which provides advanced processors like HED, MLSD, OpenPose, etc. for conditioning) ([ControlNet in  Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet#:~:text=%2A%20OpenCV%20%2A%20controlnet,processing%20models%20for%20ControlNet)) ([ControlNet in  Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet#:~:text=import%20cv2%20from%20PIL%20import,Image%20import%20numpy%20as%20np)). If you had a segmentation mask and a segmentation ControlNet, you would instead feed the mask (with appropriate palette) as `image=mask_image`. Note that the pre-trained `seg` ControlNet expects segmentation in ADE20K format (specific class colors) ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=match%20at%20L396%20Segmentation%20ControlNet,dataset%2C%20which%20is%20described%20in)), which might not match medical classes. In such cases, either retrain a ControlNet on your segmentation data or convert your mask into a format that the model understands (e.g., map your organ labels to one of the 150 ADE20K classes arbitrarily – not ideal, but a hack). Often, using edges or scribbles is simpler for medical images since edges are generic.

- **Incorporating SAM for structure**: To get the condition images, you can integrate Meta’s Segment Anything Model (available via the `segment_anything` Python package or SAM’s GitHub). Load the SAM model (possibly a MedSAM checkpoint if available) and call it on an image or set of points to obtain a mask. That mask can then be converted to an edge image or used in a segmentation ControlNet. For instance, if you want to ensure your generated brain MRI has a tumor in a specific shape, you could take a real MRI with a tumor mask, run SAM to get that tumor contour, then use that contour (edges) as ControlNet input while prompting the model for a “brain MRI”. The output will have a tumor of the same shape, but you can alter other aspects via the prompt. This approach separates *structure* (provided by SAM/ControlNet) from *appearance* (learned by the model/LoRA), giving a lot of control. 

- **Toolkits and Best Practices**: For evaluation, consider metrics like **FID** (Fréchet Inception Distance) and **Inception Score** for image realism/diversity – these were used in the MedVQA-GI study to quantify quality ([Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.20667v1#:~:text=specified%20categories,This%20advances%20the%20field)). If you specifically care about preserving anatomical labels, you can compute **Dice or IoU** between synthetic mask and original mask (if you have a ground-truth to compare to) – e.g., the endoscopy work reported IoU to measure how well structure was preserved ([
            Minimal data requirement for realistic endoscopic image generation with Stable Diffusion - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881618/#:~:text=limited%20data%20availability%20in%20clinical,We%20provide%20public%20access%20to)). It’s also good practice to have a domain expert review samples or to test if a classifier/segmenter trained on synthetic images performs well on real images ([[2305.18927] Evaluating the feasibility of using Generative Models to generate Chest X-Ray Data](http://ar5iv.org/abs/2305.18927#:~:text=,However%2C%20further%20work%20is)). Implementation-wise, use **mixed precision and acceleration**: Hugging Face Accelerate can automatically shard models across GPU/CPU if needed, and using the `UniPCMultistepScheduler` or other fast schedulers can speed up generation with minimal quality loss ([ControlNet in  Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet#:~:text=Instead%20of%20using%20Stable%20Diffusion%27s,schedulers%20can%20be%20found%20here)) ([ControlNet in  Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet#:~:text=from%20diffusers%20import%20UniPCMultistepScheduler)). On a 24 GB GPU, you can typically generate 512×512 images in batches of 4–8 comfortably; for higher resolutions (e.g. 1024×1024 with Stable Diffusion XL), consider enabling attention slicing or using FP16 for weights (which diffusers does by default in the examples above).

In summary, a possible pipeline might be: **Load base model + LoRA -> Load/prepare segmentation mask -> Extract edges via SAM or Canny -> Feed into ControlNet pipeline with text prompt -> Generate image -> Evaluate/correct structure as needed.** Each of these steps is supported by open-source tools (Hugging Face diffusers, ControlNet extensions, Segment Anything, etc.), and the cited resources provide code and checkpoints to get started. By combining a structurally annotated dataset, a fine-tuned generative model, a powerful segmentation tool, and the conditioning mechanism of ControlNet, you can generate synthetic medical images that **look realistic while rigorously preserving anatomical structure** – the key to credible and useful results in this sensitive domain.

#======================================================================================================================================================
Plan to impliment based on lessons learned from above research:

Below is a step‑by‑step blueprint that stays inside a single twenty‑four gigabyte GPU and lets you type a prompt such as  
`MRI of brain with tumor in left temporal lobe`  
and receive a realistic slice that matches the requested anatomy.

---

### 1 Choose data that already has masks  
Use the BraTS twenty twenty three collection. Each study supplies four MRI modalities plus a binary mask for enhancing tumor, core, and whole tumor. Extract axial slices that show tumor and also a balanced set of healthy slices for variety.

### 2 Prepare paired training material  
* Resize every slice and its mask to five hundred twelve by five hundred twelve.  
* Convert the three‑class BraTS mask into a single channel where tumor pixels are one and background zero. Save as PNG.  
* Build a text prompt for each slice. Example  
  * healthy slice → “T one weighted axial brain MRI”  
  * tumor slice → “T one weighted axial brain MRI with tumor in left temporal lobe”  
  You can infer location from the mask centroid and insert it into the text.

### 3 Fine tune the base diffusion model with LoRA for domain appearance  
* Start from any public checkpoint trained on natural images, for example the one called stable diffusion version one point five converted to diffusers format.  
* Run DreamBooth or the diffusers LoRA script on your slice‑prompt pairs for roughly two to three thousand steps.  
* Only UNet and text encoder receive LoRA adapters. Keep rank at four or eight to fit in memory.  
Outcome: the model now knows MRI texture and tumor intensity but is still free regarding spatial layout.

### 4 Train a segmentation‑to‑image ControlNet for structure  
* Initialize ControlNet with the official segmentation variant.  
* Use your BraTS masks (single channel) as condition input and the corresponding real slice as target image.  
* Train for roughly five to eight epochs. Keep learning rate small and freeze everything except ControlNet so training finishes in a few hours.  
If training time is an issue, you can skip this step and instead use the public Canny ControlNet together with edges extracted from the BraTS mask. The dedicated segmentation ControlNet will still give sharper borders.

### 5 Inference pipeline  
1. Load base diffusion plus LoRA adapters.  
2. Attach the trained ControlNet.  
3. Create a synthetic mask that encodes the desired tumor shape and location. Three quick options  
   * Paint a binary blob in the required region using any image editor.  
   * Take a healthy slice, draw the tumor, and run MedSAM to get a precise mask.  
   * Randomly pick a real BraTS tumor mask and paste it into a healthy background.  
4. Feed the text prompt, the mask, and guidance scales into `StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline`.  
5. Sample twenty to thirty denoising steps with a scheduler like UniPC.  

### 6 Minimal pseudocode (names written without hyphen characters)  
```python
pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml slash stable diffusion v1 dot 5",
    controlnet=ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("my_seg_controlnet")
).to("cuda").half()

pipe.load_lora_weights("my_mri_lora")
mask = Image.open("synthetic_mask.png").convert("L")  # single channel
result = pipe(
    prompt="T one weighted axial brain MRI with tumor in left temporal lobe",
    image=mask,
    num_inference_steps=30,
    guidance_scale=7.5,
    controlnet_conditioning_scale=1.0
).images[0]
result.save("synthetic_mri.png")
```

### 7 Quality checks  
* Compute Dice between the mask you supplied and a new mask predicted by MedSAM on the generated slice. High Dice means structure is preserved.  
* Run FID between a set of synthetic slices and held‑out real BraTS slices.  
* Ask a neuroradiologist or use a pretrained tumor classifier to judge realism.

### 8 Common pitfalls and fixes  
* Blurry tumors: raise ControlNet conditioning scale or lower classifier‑free guidance.  
* Hallucinated anatomy: include “no extra lesions, realistic brain anatomy” at the end of the prompt.  
* Memory overflow: enable attention slicing and set batch size to one.

This setup keeps LoRA for domain style, uses ControlNet for spatial accuracy, and remains fully runnable on my single RTX 4090.
